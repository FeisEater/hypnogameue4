# Manual

Objective is to kidnap a target named 'Target' that spends his whole time in office at Target inc.
The building has armed guards, who will open fire if they see unauthorized personnel at the second
floor, or if they see suspicious behaviour (hypnotization transactions).

NPC's can be influenced in two ways. First is intrusive hypnotization, which requires them
to fall asleep. Armed guards will open fire if they see you doing this. Second is subliminal
persuasion through conversation. This will cause no suspicion, but gives you a limited set of
influences to use. For example, detour action may be planted with both techniques, but through
hypnosis target can detour to greater lengths.

Each NPC can store limited amount of hypnotized actions, but they can be changed though intrusive
hypnotization. NPC's also have preset behaviours, such as detouring to gunshots or opening fire
on hypnotizing targets. With hypnotizations, these behaviours can be changed.

You can read your targets by pointing a cursor at them. You can read their name and their current
patrol destination. You can also see if they were previously influenced by you, have fallen asleep,
or are hunting an enemy (red skull means you are enemy, yellow skull means someone else is an enemy).
